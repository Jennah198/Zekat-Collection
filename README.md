## 🧮 Zekat & Nisab Logic

Using real-time values of **gold and silver**, Zekat obligations are calculated accurately. (Planned integration with a currency API for updated Nisab thresholds).

> *“Zekat purifies your wealth. This platform helps you fulfill that duty — clearly, consciously, and compassionately.”*
